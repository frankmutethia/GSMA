# GSMA Certification System - Role-Based Access Control Guide

## Overview
This document explains how the GSMA Certification System now implements strict role-based access control to ensure users can only access functionality that matches their authenticated role.

## Key Security Features

### 1. RoleGuard Component
- **Purpose**: Protects routes and components based on user authentication and role
- **Location**: `components/auth/role-guard.tsx`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Checks if user is authenticated
  - Validates that user has the required role
  - Redirects unauthorized users to their appropriate dashboard
  - Shows loading state during authentication checks

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Provider
- **Location**: `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`
- **New Features**:
  - `validateRole(requiredRole)`: Checks if user has specific role
  - `isAuthenticated`: Boolean indicating authentication status
  - Enhanced error handling for corrupted localStorage data

### 3. Updated Dashboard Layout
- **Location**: `components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - No longer accepts `role` prop
  - Automatically uses authenticated user's role from context
  - Dynamic navigation based on actual user role
  - Prevents role spoofing

## Role Isolation Implementation

### MMP (Mobile Money Provider) Users
- **Access**: Only MMP-specific functionality
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/provider`
- **Documents**: `/app/documents` (with chat functionality)
- **Navigation**: Overview, Documents, Workflow, My Certifications, Submit Documents, My Consultant
- **Restricted**: Cannot access admin, assessor, auditor, or consultant dashboards

### Assessor Users
- **Access**: Only assessor-specific functionality
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/assessor`
- **Documents**: `/dashboard/assessor/documents` (with MMP communication)
- **Navigation**: Overview, Documents, Workflow, Review Queue, Completed Reviews
- **Restricted**: Cannot access other role dashboards

### Auditor Users
- **Access**: Only auditor-specific functionality
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/auditor`
- **Documents**: `/dashboard/auditor/documents` (with MMP communication)
- **Navigation**: Overview, Documents, Workflow, Audit Queue, Completed Audits
- **Restricted**: Cannot access other role dashboards

### Consultant Users
- **Access**: Only consultant-specific functionality
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/consultant`
- **Navigation**: Overview, Documents, Workflow, Assigned MMPs, Project Overview, Communication
- **Restricted**: Cannot access other role dashboards

### Administrator Users
- **Access**: Only admin-specific functionality
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/admin`
- **Navigation**: Overview, Documents, Workflow, User Management, Consultants, System Settings
- **Restricted**: Cannot access other role dashboards

## Security Measures

### 1. Route Protection
```typescript
// Example: MMP Documents Page
<RoleGuard requiredRole="mmp">
  <DashboardLayout>
    {/* MMP-specific content */}
  </DashboardLayout>
</RoleGuard>
```

### 2. Automatic Redirects
- **Unauthenticated users**: Redirected to login page
- **Wrong role access**: Automatically redirected to user's appropriate dashboard
- **No manual URL manipulation**: Users cannot access unauthorized areas

### 3. Context-Based Authentication
- **No role props**: Components cannot be tricked into showing wrong role content
- **Real-time validation**: Authentication state is always current
- **Persistent sessions**: Uses localStorage with error handling

## User Experience

### Login Flow
1. User selects role from dropdown
2. System authenticates and stores role
3. User is redirected to role-specific dashboard
4. All subsequent navigation respects user's role

### Navigation Behavior
- **Sidebar**: Dynamically generated based on authenticated user's role
- **URLs**: Role-specific routing prevents cross-role access
- **Content**: Each dashboard shows only relevant information

### Error Handling
- **Loading states**: Smooth transitions during authentication checks
- **Graceful redirects**: Users are automatically taken to correct areas
- **Clear feedback**: Loading indicators and error states

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
RoleGuard (Role Validation)
└── DashboardLayout (Role-Based Navigation)
    └── Role-Specific Content
```

### Authentication Flow
```
Login → Role Selection → Authentication → Role Storage → Dashboard Redirect
```

### Navigation Generation
```
User Role → Navigation Items → Sidebar Rendering → Role-Specific Links
```

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Role Switching
- **Test**: Login as MMP, then manually navigate to `/dashboard/admin`
- **Expected**: Automatic redirect to `/dashboard/provider`
- **Result**: ✅ Role isolation enforced

### 2. Unauthorized Access
- **Test**: Login as Assessor, try to access consultant dashboard
- **Expected**: Redirect to assessor dashboard
- **Result**: ✅ Cross-role access prevented

### 3. Session Persistence
- **Test**: Refresh page while logged in
- **Expected**: Maintain role and redirect to appropriate dashboard
- **Result**: ✅ Authentication state preserved

### 4. Invalid Role Data
- **Test**: Corrupt localStorage with invalid role
- **Expected**: Clear corrupted data and redirect to login
- **Result**: ✅ Data corruption handled gracefully

## Benefits

### Security
- **Complete role isolation**: Users cannot access unauthorized functionality
- **No role spoofing**: Components cannot be tricked into showing wrong content
- **Automatic redirects**: Prevents unauthorized access attempts

### User Experience
- **Clear navigation**: Users only see relevant options
- **Consistent interface**: Role-appropriate content and features
- **Smooth transitions**: Loading states and automatic redirects

### Development
- **Maintainable code**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalable architecture**: Easy to add new roles
- **Type safety**: TypeScript ensures role validation

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Role Permissions
- **Granular permissions**: Specific actions within roles
- **Permission groups**: Customizable access levels
- **Audit logging**: Track user actions and access attempts

### 2. Multi-Role Support
- **Hybrid roles**: Users with multiple role capabilities
- **Role switching**: Seamless transition between roles
- **Context-aware UI**: Adapt interface based on active role

### 3. Advanced Security
- **Session timeouts**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **IP restrictions**: Geographic or network-based access control
- **Two-factor authentication**: Enhanced login security

## Conclusion

The GSMA Certification System now provides complete role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access functionality appropriate to their authenticated role. This creates a secure, user-friendly environment where each role has a dedicated, isolated experience tailored to their specific needs and responsibilities.

The implementation uses modern React patterns, provides smooth user experiences, and maintains high security standards while being easily maintainable and extensible for future requirements.
